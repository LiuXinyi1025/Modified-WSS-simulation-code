# Modified-WSS-simulation-code

These are three modified functions for Xinyi's MSc major individual project.
1.	judgeH: Determining whether the fluid height is greater than 0 throughout the duration of the shear application (i.e., to ensure that the cells are covered by medium).
2.	sheardistribution: Obtaining the shear stress distribution by traversing each location within the cylinder.
3.	AWSS: Plotting the time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and maximum wall shear stress (maxWSS) over an oscillation period as a function of radial distance. Here, TAWSS refers to the average magnitude of shear stress experienced within an oscillation period in a specific location, whereas maxWSS means the highest shear stress at the same location within that period.
